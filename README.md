## üõ†Ô∏è Skip Selection UI Update ‚Äì Feature Description

### ‚ú® UI/UX Improvements

- **Redesigned Product Cards**  
  I updated the product card styles to better capture user attention. Previously, the cards included repetitive buttons like **"Select this skip"** and **"Selected"**, which felt intrusive and overly forceful. These have been removed for a cleaner, more intuitive experience.

- **Card Interaction Behavior**  
  Initially, the UI displayed a list of skip cards with a simple layout and no continue button. When a user clicks on a card, it dynamically updates its visual style to reflect selection. This helps the user clearly identify their chosen skip without extra steps. The selected skip‚Äôs price is also displayed in the **Action Bar** below.

- **Action Bar Enhancements**  
  The Action Bar has been redesigned to provide clear navigation and pricing details. It includes a back button, a continue button, and displays the total price for the selected skip. This total includes the skip base price, VAT, and transportation costs. A small arrow next to the total reveals a detailed price breakdown, allowing users to see exactly what they're being charged ‚Äî promoting transparency and user trust.
  - Additionally, the total price is now positioned near the Continue button to improve usability. This ensures that when users are ready to proceed, the cost is clearly visible at the point of action. Previously, the price was shown on the left side, which was less intuitive than the current placement.

### üñºÔ∏è Visual & Content Improvements

- **Sample Skipper Image**  
  Since the retrieved data didn‚Äôt include images for skippers, I added a static placeholder image. The background was removed to create a cleaner, more visually appealing presentation of the skipper.

- **Color Theme**  
  An **orange color scheme** was chosen to reflect an industrial feel. As many construction-related tools and equipment feature yellow or orange tones, this theme aligns well with user expectations and enhances visual coherence.

### üì± Responsive Design

- The layout is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes ‚Äî from desktop monitors to mobile devices ‚Äî ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across platforms.
